# Counting-Lesser-Number

Problem Statement - Paul has a set of unique numbers. He wants to store numbers in a binary tree such that whenever a number is given, he can exactly tell how many numbers are less than the given number.

Help Paul by coding the logic in your language of choice without using any libraries for tree implementation.

Solution - I used binary search tree to solve this problem.
